## Description

_This is an exercise for Epicodus to practice functional programming. The program makes use of storing state within a function and composes function factories for generating reusble code. Specifically, this program allows you to add soil, water, and light to four different plants. Each plant also comes with special propery of their own, which the user can manipulate through forms. Orchids have a color property; palms, a shade property; catcti, a poke property; and succulents, a charm property. Have fun!_
